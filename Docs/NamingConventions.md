# Naming Conventions

We adhere to consistent **naming conventions** to ensure that our codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable. By following these standards, both current and future developers can easily understand and work with the code.

## Database Tables

For **database tables**, we use the **Train-Case** naming convention. This style improves readability and ensures consistency across all database entities.

### Examples of Train-Case:
- `Lorem-Ipsum`
- `Lorem-Ipsum-Dolor`

> **Note**: Each word is capitalized, and words are separated by hyphens (`-`), making it easy to identify separate concepts.

## Coding Functions

For **functions**, we use **PascalCase** (also known as **UpperCamelCase**). This convention enhances code clarity and avoids unnecessary complexity in function names.

### Examples of PascalCase/UpperCamelCase:
- `LoremIpsum`
- `LoremIpsumDolor`

> **Note**: The first letter of each word is capitalized, without any separators, making function names clean and easy to read.

## Variables

For **variables**, we use **camelCase**. This widely recognized convention promotes simplicity and readability, ensuring that variable names are consistent and well-structured.

### Examples of camelCase:
- `loremIpsum`
- `loremIpsumDolor`

> **Note**: The first word starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words are capitalized, with no separators.

By adhering to these naming conventions, we ensure that our code is **consistent**, **professional**, and **easy to maintain**. Following these practices helps create a codebase that is both **elegant** and **functional**, benefiting everyone involved in the development process.
