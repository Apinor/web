Naming Conventions
  We use consistent naming conventions to ensure that our code is easy to read, maintain, and understand. 
  These conventions are designed to make the codebase accessible to both current and future developers.

Database Tables:
  For database creation and table naming, we use the naming convention referred to as Train-Case. 
  This style enhances readability and ensures consistency in how database entities are named.

    Examples of Train-Case:

      `Lorem-Ipsum`
      `Lorem-Ipsum-Dolor`
      
Coding Functions:
  For functions, we use the naming convention referred to as PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase). 
  This naming style promotes clarity and keeps the codebase clean, while avoiding unnecessary characters or complexity.

    Examples of PascalCase/UpperCamelCase:

      `LoremIpsum`
      `LoremIpsumDolor`

Variables:
  For variables, we use the naming convention referred to as camelCase. 
  This style is widely recognized for its simplicity and readability, contributing to a clean and organized codebase.

    Examples of camelCase:

      `loremIpsum`
      `loremIpsumDolor`

This structure ensures that our code remains consistent, professional, and easy to work with for everyone involved. By following these naming conventions, we aim to create a codebase that is both elegant and functional.
