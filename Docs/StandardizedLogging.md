Standardized logging:
  We use standardised logging for a simpler reading experience of the code, and or markup.

    logging examples:

      `INFO: Significant and noteworthy business events`
      `WARN: Abnormal situations that may indicate future problems`
      `ERROR: Unrecoverable errors that affect a specific operation`
      `FATAL: Unrecoverable errors that affect the entire program`
