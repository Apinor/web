# Standardized Logging for the Project

Logging is an essential practice for maintaining a reliable and debuggable codebase. By adhering to standardized logging conventions, we ensure consistent, meaningful, and actionable log messages that simplify debugging, monitoring, and understanding the application.

## Why Standardized Logging?
- **Consistency**: Ensures log messages are structured and predictable.
- **Debugging**: Simplifies identifying and resolving issues.
- **Monitoring**: Helps track application behavior and performance.

## Logging Levels
We use four distinct logging levels to categorize log messages based on their severity and purpose.

### Logging Levels and Best Practices

1. **INFO**
   - **Purpose**: Captures general information about the system's normal operations.
   - **Use Case**: Tracks events that do not indicate problems but are helpful for auditing and understanding the system's flow.

   #### Examples:
   - `INFO: User 'john_doe' logged in successfully.`
     - **Context**: A user has logged in, this is useful for auditing and tracking user actions.
   - `INFO: Daily report generated at 3:00 AM.`
     - **Context**: Indicates the completion of a scheduled task, important for monitoring system activities.
   - `INFO: Application started on port 8080.`
     - **Context**: Marks the start of the application, important for understanding when the application was initialized and ready for use.
   - `INFO: Cache cleared successfully after 24 hours of inactivity.`
     - **Context**: This helps track cache maintenance activities.
   - `INFO: User 'jane_doe' updated her profile settings.`
     - **Context**: Logs changes to user profiles, useful for auditing purposes.

2. **WARN**
   - **Purpose**: Flags abnormal situations that could indicate potential problems in the future.
   - **Use Case**: Early indicators of issues that may require investigation but do not disrupt the system.

   #### Examples:
   - `WARN: Disk space is below 10%.`
     - **Context**: Alerts administrators about a disk space issue that could lead to performance degradation or application failures.
   - `WARN: Attempted to fetch data from an unavailable API endpoint.`
     - **Context**: Indicates that a non-critical API failed temporarily but can be retried or investigated later.
   - `WARN: Deprecated function 'getOldData' used in module X.`
     - **Context**: Alerts developers about using an outdated function that will eventually be removed, prompting them to refactor the code.
   - `WARN: High memory usage detected (90%) on server 'webserver01'.`
     - **Context**: Indicates a potential performance issue, allowing administrators to investigate before it leads to an out-of-memory error.
   - `WARN: Failed to connect to external analytics service, retrying in 10 seconds.`
     - **Context**: Alerts that an external service is temporarily unavailable, without immediately impacting user experience.

3. **ERROR**
   - **Purpose**: Logs unrecoverable errors that affect specific operations but not the entire application.
   - **Use Case**: Highlights issues that require developer attention.

   #### Examples:
   - `ERROR: Failed to write data to database 'orders_db'.`
     - **Context**: A critical operation (writing to the database) failed, and the application should not proceed without fixing the issue.
   - `ERROR: Payment transaction ID 12345 returned 'Invalid Card Details'.`
     - **Context**: Captures failed payment attempts, useful for tracking and debugging failed transactions.
   - `ERROR: NullPointerException encountered in UserService.java at line 45.`
     - **Context**: A specific error occurred within the code, and developers need to investigate the exact location of the issue.
   - `ERROR: Missing required configuration key 'API_KEY' in environment variables.`
     - **Context**: Flags a configuration issue that prevents certain operations from functioning.
   - `ERROR: Unable to process user registration, 'email' field is null.`
     - **Context**: Provides clear insight into a failed registration attempt due to a missing required field.

4. **FATAL**
   - **Purpose**: Logs critical errors that cause the application to crash or become unusable.
   - **Use Case**: Highlights system-wide failures requiring immediate attention.

   #### Examples:
   - `FATAL: Unable to load configuration file; application shutting down.`
     - **Context**: A crucial configuration file is missing or corrupt, leading to a full application shutdown.
   - `FATAL: Out of memory. System halted.`
     - **Context**: The application has run out of memory, and the system cannot function until resolved.
   - `FATAL: Failed to bind to port 443. Exiting program.`
     - **Context**: A network binding error occurs on a critical port, preventing the application from starting up.
   - `FATAL: Database connection failed; cannot continue without database access.`
     - **Context**: The application depends on a database and cannot function without it, leading to an immediate failure.
   - `FATAL: Unrecoverable error in core module 'AuthenticationService'. Application terminating.`
     - **Context**: A critical error in the authentication service requires the application to shut down.

### Logging Best Practices
- **Be Descriptive**: Include relevant context in log messages, such as user IDs, operation details, or module names. This makes logs more actionable and helps developers quickly understand the situation.
   - Example: `INFO: User 'john_doe' updated their shipping address to '123 Main St'.`
   
- **Avoid Noise**: Log only necessary information to prevent clutter and maintain clarity. Avoid logging too much trivial data that does not aid in debugging or monitoring.
   - Avoid logging: `INFO: User clicked on button A.`
   - Instead, focus on critical actions like: `INFO: User 'john_doe' initiated password reset request.`

- **Use Levels Appropriately**: Match the log level to the severity and purpose of the event. Don't log critical errors with a low severity level (e.g., logging fatal errors as `INFO`).
   - `ERROR: Failed to process payment` should not be logged as `INFO`.

- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and test logs to ensure they remain useful and clear. Remove unnecessary logs and ensure that error logs are actionable and provide clear context for resolution.
   - **Periodic log review**: Ensure logs are following best practices and do not include unnecessary information or outdated log messages that no longer apply to the current codebase.

By following these logging best practices and using standardized levels, youâ€™ll ensure that your logs are meaningful, actionable, and easy to monitor.
